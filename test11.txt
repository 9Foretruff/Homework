As I die, then bury
Me in the grave
Among the wide steppe
In the dear Ukraine,

That the widest fields,
And the cliffs and Dnipro*
I can see and I can hear,
With it mighty roar.

As it'll carry from Ukraine
Into the blue sea
Blood of enemy... and then I
The mountains and fields-

I'll leave everything, and fly
To almighty God
To pray... and before
I didn't know God.

Bury me and rise up,
Rip your chains off
And the evil blood of foe
Sprinkle on the freedom

And me in this great family,
In family that's new and free,
With a kind and quiet word
Don't forget to remember me.

				Taras Shevchenko
Battle on â€“ and win your battle!
